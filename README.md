# laraveljwt-js

Package that can handle the authentication for your client side app using `Promises` and `Localstorage`. This package was build for my own needs but I was using it all the time for my projects so I would like to open source it for other people who are using Laravel JWT as authentication. The package contains a `ES6 Class` and some Helper functions that can be easily imported in one of your `Vue`, `React` or any other client side projects.
